# house-price-prediction
Briefly mention the problem, tools you'll use, and sections (EDA, training, etc.)

Problem:
This project predicts house prices based on various features using regression models. 
It is built as part of my machine learning learning journey, applying what I learned from the Supervised ML and Advanced Learning Algorithms courses.
